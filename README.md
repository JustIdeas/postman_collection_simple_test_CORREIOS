For this project, the goal is to create a collection that validates the CEP return of correios API, using WSDL.

So I have create a collection that uses the pre script to gather the informations need it to create the body of the request, and after that, I used
the Test feature to do 6 tests.

To be able to run this project, you will need a Postman application, import the collection file and the environment file.
After that, just run the collection, that already has a CEP configured in it to be able to execute.
